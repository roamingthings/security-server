Security Server
===============

While I've been tinkering around with Spring Security and all the nice things it offers I became very interested in this
domain. Also I know there are a lot of good ready-to-use servers and services out there I wanted to have a field to
experiment with the thing that Spring offers.

I decided to start this project as an independent server which offers SSO authorization and user management for the other
 services and clients I plan to build.

Obtain a token
--------------

```
$ curl -v POST -H 'Authorization: Basic Zm9vQ2xpZW50SWRQYXNzd29yZDpzZWNyZXQ=' 'http://localhost:8080/oauth/token' -d 'grant_type=password&username=user&password=simple' \
```

where `Zm9vQ2xpZW50SWRQYXNzd29yZDpzZWNyZXQ=` is the Base64 encoded 'fooClientIdPassword:secret' Basic Auth header
